Title: High-Probability Lower Bounds for the Total Variance Distance 
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Loris Michel, Jeffrey Naef
Maintainer: Loris Michel <michel@stat.math.ethz.ch>
Description: An implementation of high-probability lower bounds for the total variance distance 
             as introduced in Michel & Naef & Meinshausen (2020) <arXiv:2005.06006>. An estimated 
             lower-bound (with high-probability) on the total variation distance between two probability distributions from which
             samples are observed can be obtained with the function HPLB.
